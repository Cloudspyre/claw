Parts List and Links

Here’s a list of the parts we used and where you can get them.  Swap out the parts as you’d like!  When you add it up it can get a little pricey, but remember, you can add pieces a few at a time till you have a nice collection.  Then you can swap out the servos and brackets for other projects.
