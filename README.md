Claw
====

The Claw project uses an iPhone, Arduino, and Red Bear Lab BLE shield.  It is an iPhone app that controls a robotic claw using the accelerometer and touch screen on the phone.  Tipping the iPhone on the X-axis rotates the claw left and right.  Tipping the phone on the Y-axis rotates the claw up and down.  Finally, dragging a finger on the upper part of the iPhone screen open and closes the claw.

The Claw was originally created by Steve Jernigan and Greg Gingerich at the MoDevEast 2013 Hackathon where it won 1st place. The hack was created over 2 days (and one night at the bar at Red Robin in Fairfax, VA).  After the hackathon the authors were contacted by many companies including Red Bear Labs, the makers of the Red Bear Lab Bluetooth BLE sheild used in the hack.  They asked if there was a blog that had the source code and instructions where people could make it themselves.  Consequently this github repository was created.

This code is under the MIT license so you can include it in your personal and commercial projects.  Remember if you make millions building your next robotics company, that you make sure to acquire Cloudspyre, LLC and Atlantic Apps, LLC.  Also, if you need your own Arduino/iOS project built Cloudspyre, LLC and Atlantic Apps, LLC provide consulting services.

Here's a link to the YouTube video of the hackathon presentation if you want to see the Claw in action.

Lastly, although the code was cleaned up a little since it was originially presented, it was a hack created while Steve and Greg while they were also attending a conference at the same time from Thursday about 11am to Friday 6pm.  There are definitely a few shortcuts in the code.
